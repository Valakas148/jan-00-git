SEASON 1
In 1983, he was working in a retail store called 'Cho's' as a clerk, but his life changed when he helped Rob Volpe and his family acquire and purchase some cocaine, which is how he met Avi Drexler,
an ex-Mossad agent who now runs his own syndicate. Since then, he was peddling kilos from Avi's place and selling them to Claudia Crane, a nightclub owner in South Central, who his Auntie Louie introduced him to.
He tried to get his uncle Jerome to help him in the cocaine business, but Jerome refused upright, making it known that yeyo is a product that cannot be sold in the black community and should only be sold to white folks.
In Oakland, when he, Leon, and Kevin were preparing to do a deal with the Murder Dubb Devils MC, he discovered a new type of drug that has never hit LA from a homeless junkie living inside a former Black Panther office.
He is then introduced to Reg, a crack dealer, and shows him the kilos of coke. He is then introduced to Swim and learns how to convert cocaine into crack and tells both Leon and Kevin that crack is the future of their drug empire.
He solidified his foothold as LA's notorious kingpin after he forced Ray-Ray at gunpoint to kill Lenny as payback for nearly killing Leon.
